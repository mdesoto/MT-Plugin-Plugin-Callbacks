## Overview

Movable Type exposes a number of different callbacks that developers can hook their code to. Missing, however, are callbacks triggered by events occurring to plugins themselves. This plugin adds those callbacks.

Currently the only callbacks are pre/post_save events. They are triggered just before and just after a plugin saves the settings to the database.

Other callbacks can be added as requested.


## How to Use

Add these lines to the callbacks section of your plugin's config.yaml file:

callbacks:
    pc_pre_save: $Example::Example::Plugin::pre_save
    pc_post_save: $Example::Example::Plugin::post_save


Then consume the callbacks like so:

sub pre_save {
    my ($cb, $param, $scope, $pdata) = @_;

    # Do your thing.
}
