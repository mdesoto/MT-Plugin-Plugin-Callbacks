## Overview

Movable Type exposes a number of different callbacks that developers can hook 
their code to. But sometimes you want a little extra mustard. Sometimes you
just need a callback in a certain place. This plugin demonstrates how to do
exactly that.

Whether you should is not a topic I'm going to cover here. Just be aware that
there are very good reasons not to do this, and that there are other ways of
accomplishing the same thing.


## How to Use

Other plugins can consume your custom callbacks by doing something like this
in their config.yaml file:

callbacks:
    pc_pre_save: $Example::Example::Plugin::pre_save
    pc_post_save: $Example::Example::Plugin::post_save


And then they consume the callbacks like so:

sub pre_save {
    my ($cb, $param, $scope, $pdata) = @_;

    # Do your thing.
}

This process should already be familiar to developers. The real magic occurs 
in the overriding of MT's core methods as demonstrated in this plugin's 
Plugin.pm file.


## A Note

You should not use this plugin as is. The specific callbacks demonstrated by 
this plugin are already built into the core MT:Object system and so this code
should serve only as an example of what you *can* do. If you need to use the 
pre/post_save callback on a plugin you *should* use:

callbacks:
    MT::PluginData::pre_save: $Example::Example::Plugin::pre_save
    MT::PluginData::post_save: $Example::Example::Plugin::post_save
